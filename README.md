![PGN Chess](/resources/chess-move.jpg?raw=true)

This is a simple, friendly, and powerful PGN (Portable Game Notation) library for running chess games from within PHP applications. It is a chess board representation that can be used in chess engines, chess applications and chess algorithms.

PGN Chess can play and validate PGN notated games, and comes to the rescue in the following scenarios:

- Develop APIs on the server side for validating chess games
- Create funny, random games for fun
- Analyze games of chess
- Validate games
- Build chess-related web apps
- Play chess moves

### 0. Example

Look at [React PGN Chess](https://github.com/programarivm/react-pgn-chess), this is a basic chess server that uses PGN Chess along with [Ratchet](http://socketo.me/) (PHP WebSockets).

### 1. Install

Via composer:

    $ composer require programarivm/pgn-chess

### 2. Instantiation

Just instantiate a game and play PGN moves:

```php
<?php

use PGNChess\Game;

$game = new Game;

$isLegalMove = $game->play('w', 'e4');
```
All action takes place in the `$game` object. The call to the `$board->play` method returns `true` or `false` depending on whether or not a chess move can be run on the board.

> **Side note**: For further information about how chess moves and PGN symbols are managed internally please look at the [PGN](https://github.com/programarivm/pgn-chess/tree/master/src/PGN) folder.

It is up to you how to process the moves accordingly -- go into a loop till the player runs a valid move, ask them to please try again, play a sound, exit the game or whatever thing you consider appropriate. The important thing is that PGN Chess understands chess rules, internally replicating the game being played on the board.

> **Side note**: PGN Chess games are actually run in the computer's memory. So, if it turns out that for whatever reason a player forgets to append the + symbol to their check moves, PGN Chess will anyway understand that it is a check move. The same thing goes for checkmate moves.

### 3. Game methods

#### 3.1. `isCheck()`

Finds out if the game is in check.

```php
$isCheck = $game->isCheck();
```

#### 3.2. `isMate()`

Finds out if the game is over.

```php
$isMate = $game->isMate();
```

#### 3.3. `status()`

Gets the current game's status.

    $status = $game->status();

`$status` is a PHP object containing useful information about the game being played.

| Property       | Description                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `turn`         | The current player's turn                  |
| `squares`      | Free/used squares on the board             |
| `control`      | Squares controlled by both players         |
| `castling`     | The castling status of the two kings       |

The following sequence of moves:

```php
<?php

$game = new Game;

$game->play('w', 'd4');
$game->play('b', 'c6');
$game->play('w', 'Bf4');
$game->play('b', 'd5');
$game->play('w', 'Nc3');
$game->play('b', 'Nf6');
$game->play('w', 'Bxb8');
$game->play('b', 'Rxb8');

$status = $game->status();
```

Will generate this `$status` object:

                    [O-O] => 1
                    [O-O-O] =>
                )

        )

    )

The status properties of the game can be easily accessed this way:

```php
<?php

// current turn
$game->status()->turn;

// used/free squares
$game->status()->squares->used;
$game->status()->squares->free;

// white's control
$game->status()->control->space->{'w'};
$game->status()->control->attack->{'w'};

// black's control
$game->status()->control->space->{'b'};
$game->status()->control->attack->{'b'};

// white's castling
$game->status()->castling->{'w'}->castled;
$game->status()->castling->{'w'}->{'O-O'};
$game->status()->castling->{'w'}->{'O-O-O'};

// black's castling
$game->status()->castling->{'b'}->castled;
$game->status()->castling->{'b'}->{'O-O'};
$game->status()->castling->{'b'}->{'O-O-O'};
```

#### 3.4. `piece()`

Gets a piece by its position on the board.

    $piece = $game->piece('c8');

`$piece` is a PHP object containing information about the chess piece selected:

| Property       | Description                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `color`        | The piece's color in PGN format            |
| `identity`     | The piece's identity in PGN format         |
| `position`     | The piece's position on the board          |
| `moves`        | The piece's possible moves                 |

The following code:

```php
<?php

$game = new Game;

$piece = $game->piece('b8');
```

Will generate this `$piece` object:

    stdClass Object
    (
        [color] => b
        [identity] => N
        [position] => b8
        [moves] => Array
            (
                [0] => a6
                [1] => c6
            )

    )

The piece's properties can be easily accessed this way:

```php
<?php

$piece->color;
$piece->identity;
$piece->position;
$piece->moves;
```

#### 3.5. `pieces()`

Gets the pieces on the board by color.

    $blackPieces = $game->pieces('b');

`$blackPieces` is an array of PHP objects containing information about black pieces.

| Property       | Description                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `identity`     | The piece's identity in PGN format         |
| `position`     | The piece's position on the board          |
| `moves`        | The piece's possible moves                 |

The following code:

```php
<?php

$game = new Game;

$blackPieces = $game->pieces('b');
```

Will generate this `$blackPieces` array of objects:

Pieces' properties can be easily accessed this way:

```php
<?php

$blackPieces[1]->identity;
$blackPieces[1]->position;
$blackPieces[1]->moves;
```

#### 3.6. `history()`

Gets the game's history.

    $history = $game->history();

The following sequence of moves:

```php
<?php

$game = new Game;

$game->play('w', 'd4');
$game->play('b', 'c6');
$game->play('w', 'Bf4');
$game->play('b', 'd5');
$game->play('w', 'Nc3');
$game->play('b', 'Nf6');
$game->play('w', 'Bxb8');
$game->play('b', 'Rxb8');

$history = $game->history();
```

Will generate this `$history` array:

    Array
    (

            [isCapture] => 1
            [isCheck] =>
        )

    )

#### 3.7. `captures()`

Gets the pieces captured by both players.

    $captures = $game->captures();

The following sequence of moves:

```php
<?php

$game = new Game;

$game->play('w', 'd4');
$game->play('b', 'c6');
$game->play('w', 'Bf4');
$game->play('b', 'd5');
$game->play('w', 'Nc3');
$game->play('b', 'Nf6');
$game->play('w', 'Bxb8');
$game->play('b', 'Rxb8');

$captures = $game->captures();
```

Will generate this `$captures` array:

    stdClass Object
    (
        [w] => Array
            (
                [0] => stdClass Object

### 4. Command Line Interface (CLI)

Make sure to have an `.env` file in your app's root folder:

    APP_ENV=dev

    DB_DRIVER=mysql
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASSWORD=password
    DB_NAME=pgn_chess
    DB_PORT=3306

#### 4.1. `db-create.php`

Creates a MySQL PGN Chess database.

    php db-create.php
    This will remove the current PGN Chess database and the data will be lost.
    Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): y

#### 4.2. `pgn-tomysql.php`

Converts a PGN file into a MySQL `INSERT` statement.

    php pgn-tomysql.php example.pgn > example.sql

This is the output generated.

#### 4.3. `pgn-syntax.php`

Checks the syntax of a PGN file.

    php pgnsyntax.php games.pgn
    This will search for syntax errors in the PGN file.
    Large files (for example 50MB) may take a few seconds to be parsed.
    Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): y
    Whoops! Sorry but this is not a valid PGN file.

    Please check these games. Do they provide the STR (Seven Tag Roster)? Is the movetext valid?

#### 4.4. `db-seed.php`

Seeds the PGN Chess database with games.

    php db-seed.php Alekhine.pgn
    This will search for valid PGN games in the file.
    Large files (for example 50MB) may take a few seconds to be inserted into the database.
    Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): y
    Good! This is a valid PGN file. 3201 games were inserted into the database.
