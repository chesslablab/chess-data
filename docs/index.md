PGN Chess is a chess board representation to play and validate PGN games (player vs player). It also provides with a PHP CLI command to seed a database with PGN games.

### Install

Via composer:

    $ composer require programarivm/pgn-chess

### Instantiation

Just instantiate a game and play PGN moves:

```php
<?php

use PGNChess\Game;

$game = new Game;

$isLegalMove = $game->play('w', 'e4');
```
All action takes place in the `$game` object. The call to the `$game->play` method returns `true` or `false` depending on whether or not a chess move can be run on the board.
