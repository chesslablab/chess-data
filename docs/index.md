The simplest yet powerful MySQL chess database to learn and play chess online.

## Installation

Clone the `chesslablab/chess-data` repo into your projects folder. Then `cd` the `chess-data` directory and create an `.env` file:

```txt
cp .env.example .env
```

Run the Docker container in detached mode in the background:

```txt
docker compose up -d
```

Update the `.env` file to your specific needs and create the `chess` database:

```text
docker exec -itu 1000:1000 chess_data_php php cli/db-create.php
```

## Bootstrapping

The chess database consists of these tables: `games`, `openings` and `users`.

```text
mysql> show tables;
+-----------------+
| Tables_in_chess |
+-----------------+
| games           |
| openings        |
| users           |
+-----------------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The `games` table is to be seeded with PGN files, the `openings` table with CSV files, and the `users` table with fake random generated usernames.

### 🗒 `games`

This table can be seeded with the PGN files contained in the `data/example` folder, and can be loaded either all at once or file by file as it is shown in the examples below.

Seed the `games` table with all the files contained in the `data/example` folder:

```text
docker exec -itu 1000:1000 chess_data_php php cli/seed/games.php data/example
✗ 2 games did not pass the validation.
✓ 4142 games out of a total of 4144 are OK.
✓ 597 games out of a total of 597 are OK.
✗ 1 games did not pass the validation.
✓ 1824 games out of a total of 1825 are OK.
✓ 3878 games out of a total of 3878 are OK.
✓ 4646 games out of a total of 4646 are OK.
✗ 2 games did not pass the validation.
✓ 2126 games out of a total of 2128 are OK.
✓ 2275 games out of a total of 2275 are OK.
✓ 1218 games out of a total of 1218 are OK.
✓ 827 games out of a total of 827 are OK.
✗ 5 games did not pass the validation.
✓ 1341 games out of a total of 1346 are OK.
✓ 5662 games out of a total of 5662 are OK.
✓ 3444 games out of a total of 3444 are OK.
```

Seed the `games` table file by file:

```text
docker exec -itu 1000:1000 chess_data_php php cli/seed/games.php data/example/Anand.pgn
✗ 2 games did not pass the validation.
✓ 4142 games out of a total of 4144 are OK.
```

The `games` table can also be seeded with your own set of PGN files in the `data/games` folder:

```text
docker exec -itu 1000:1000 chess_data_php php cli/seed/games.php data/games
```

Please note that all files in the `data` folder are gitignored except those contained in `data/example`. The chess games won't be loaded into the database if containing PGN tags other than the ones supported by the tables created in the [cli/db-create.php](https://github.com/chesslablab/chess-data/blob/main/cli/db-create.php) script. If that is the case you may want to remove the unsupported tags as shown in the example below.

```text
find . -name '*.pgn' -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i "/\[PlyCount .*\]/d"
```

### 🗒 `openings`

This table is seeded with the CSV files contained in the `data/openings` folder.

```text
docker exec -itu 1000:1000 chess_data_php php cli/seed/openings.php data/openings
```

### 🗒 `users`

This is how to seed the `users` table with fake random generated usernames:

```text
docker exec -itu 1000:1000 chess_data_php php cli/seed/users.php 5000
```
